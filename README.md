# GoCode Colorado - Analysis

The first dataset we focused on was 'Degrees Awarded to Post-Secondary Graduates in Colorado'.

Description of the dataset: 'Demographics for all certificate, degree, or formal award approved by Colorado Department of Higher Education (CDHE) for students since 2001. Demographics include data on age, ethnicity, program name, and residency.'

## Breakdown in Institutions attended

There are 29 unique institutions described in the dataset. For any given year, if the attendees associated with the institution was greater than 5% of total attendees for the year, the institution is represented. For all institutions which make up less than or equal to 5% of total attendees, that institution is grouped into 'Other'

------------- |

From 2001 to 2017 we can see still about half of institution attendees are enrolling in smaller institutions (those individual institutions which make of less than 5% of total attendees for the year)

We see the percent of attendees enrolling in community colleges and other more affordable institutions increasing. Front Range Community Collage, Colorado Mountain College, and Pikes Peak Community College are all more prevalent in 2017 than they were in 2001.

On the flip-side, larger more expensive institutions have seen the percent of attendees decreasing. This can be seen with Colorado State University, University of Colorado Denver, and University of Colorado Boulder from 2001 to 2017.

## Breakdown of Degrees Pursued

Attendees of the institutions are in various degree programs, which include: Associate, Bachelor, Certificate, Doctoral, Masters, OtherGraduate, Professional, Specialist. We can look at how the breakdown of degrees have changed from 2001 to 2017.
